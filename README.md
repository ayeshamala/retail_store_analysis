# Retail Sales Analysis

## Project Background
The ABC Company is a US-based retail store that sells popular products in Housekeeping, Office Supplies, Furnishings, Maintenance, and Public Areas. The company only sells products out of a physical location in major cities in 18 US States. 

The company has a significant amount of data on its sales pattern related to geographical locations, product categories, and the products sold within those categories, but the data was never fully utilized for marketing efforts and sales analysis. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes the data from 2015 and 2016 to uncover critical insights to improve marketing strategies and sales practices. 

Insights and recommendations are provided in the following areas:

- **Sales Performance**: Trend analysis in sales over time by highlighting the best-selling products and showcasing seasonal variations.
- **Product Analysis**: Analysis of the product catalog to determine which products have the highest demand, profit margins, and return rates.
- **Regional Insights**: Exploration of property information to identify regions with the highest sales volumes and profitability.

## Executive Summary
In 2015, The ABC Company experienced stronger revenue performance, with a decline of 2.03% in total revenue recorded for 2016. However, there was no significant difference in the number of orders received or product sales between the two years. Key performance indicators show that although there is a slight decline in the revenue generated, there was actually a 1.3% increase in product sales, which indicates that the products with lower price value were sold more compared to the products with higher price value.
